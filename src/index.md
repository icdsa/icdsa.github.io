## Welcome to Iowa City DSA! We’re excited to have you!

The DSA is the fastest-growing socialist organization in the United States. We need you (and your friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors) to pitch in, show up, and win a new world. There’s no time to lose and everything to win. 

We are Democratic Socialists because we share a vision of a humane international social order based on democratic planning and market mechanisms to achieve equitable resource distribution, meaningful work, a healthy environment, sustainable growth, gender, sexual, and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.

DSA is not a political party or a movement with a narrow, unchanging view of how to achieve our collective political goals. Rather, it’s a collection of organizers with the ultimate goal of building our members’ collective power and organizing skills at the hyperlocal level while acting together as a cohesive body against capitalism.

The principal goal of DSA is the complete elimination of capitalist modes of economic organization and all interrelated forms of oppression. DSA members typically believe that capitalism is inseparable from racism, misogyny, ableism, anti-LGBTQIA+ violence, classism, and the myriad intersecting forms of oppression we experience and witness daily.
