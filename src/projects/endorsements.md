title: November 2025 Endorsements
layout: split.njk
---

The Iowa City chapter of the Democratic Socialist of America interviewed local candidates as part of our endorsement process. Those interviews are meant to be public, and so we are providing them here and on social media.

Even the candidates we ultimately did not endorse are included here, as our goal is to promote the values of democracy. Everyone is entitled to build their own opinions for voting, and perhaps you are also interested in why we came to our conclusions.


Here is the link to all the materials: [Drive](https://drive.proton.me/urls/K4K30HVXK4#hgL53fvC3FbD)

So for every folder in the drive is a few things:
1. 1: A PDF of the questionnaire and the responses summarized
2. 2: The full interview audio
3. 3: A fully split interview audio labeled in order of the questionnaire

The following links can be used to sign up for each of the prospective candidates volunteer list:

We hope you find this information useful for voting and for energizing your participation in the electoral process. 

Thereâ€™s a lot of work left to be done, and every little contribution helps.
